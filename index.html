                 <p>[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]</p>
                 <p>It's been a hard day's night</p>
                 <p>And I've been working like a dog</p>
                 <p>It's been a hard day's night</p>
                 <p>I should be sleeping like a log</p>
                 <p>But when I get home to you</p>
                 <p>I find the things that you do</p>
                 <p>Will make me feel alright</p>
                 <p>[Verse 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]</p>
                 <p>You know I work all day</p>
                 <p>To get you money to buy you things</p>
                 <p>And it's worth it just to hear you say</p>
                 <p>You're gonna give me everything</p>
                 <p>So why on Earth should I moan?</p>
                 <p>'Cause when I get you alone</p>
                 <p>You know I feel okay</p>

                 <p>Everything seems to be right</p>
                 <p>When I'm home</p>
                 <p>Feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah!</p>
                 <p>[Verse 3: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]</p>
                 <p>It's been a hard day's night</p>
                 <p>And I've been working like a dog</p>

                <p>That I would love everything that you do</p>
                <p>And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do</p>
                <p>[Verse 2]</p>
                <p>Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be</p>
                <p>This could only happen to me</p>
                <p>Can't you see, can't you see?</p>
                <p>[Bridge]</p>
                <p>That when I tell you that I love you, oh</p>
                <p>You're gonna say you love me too, oh</p>
                <p>And when I ask you to be mine</p>
                <p>You're gonna say you love me too</p>
                <p>[Verse 3]</p>
                <p>So I should have realized a lot of things before</p>
                <p>If this is love, you've got to give me more</p>
                <p>Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more</p>

                <p>If I give my heart to you </p>
                <p> I must be sure </p>
                <p> From the very start, that you</p>

                <p> If I love you too, oh please</p>
                <p>Don't hurt my pride like her</p>

                <p> Was in vain</p>
                <p> So I hope you see that I</p>
